          <p>
            Acme Web Design is a fictional company often used in examples and scenarios, particularly in the context of 
            web design, development, and digital marketing. It's a placeholder name that doesn't refer to any specific 
            real-world company. When discussing web design principles, coding tutorials, or marketing strategies, instructors
            and writers frequently use "Acme Web Design" to illustrate concepts without promoting any particular brand or service. 
            It's similar to using "John Doe" or "Jane Smith" as generic names for individuals in legal or medical contexts.
        </p>
          <p class="dark">
            "Acme Web Design" is primarily a placeholder name often used in examples, 
            tutorials, and educational materials related to web design, development, 
            and digital marketing. However, if you're referring to a specific real-world 
            company named Acme Web Design, I would need more context or information to provide 
            details about it. If it's an actual company, it could offer services such as website 
            design, development, graphic design, branding, digital marketing, and related services. 
            If you have specific questions or aspects you'd like to know about Acme Web Design,
            please provide more details!
